Project 4: Generate insights to solve a supply chain issue in the FMCG domain.
Difficulty: 3/5

Problem Statement
CLIFE Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Ogun, Nigeria. It is currently operational in three cities: Lagos, Port Harcourt, and Ibadan. They want to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.

CLIFE Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continuous period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and has requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service levels for all the customer's daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘On-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’, and OnTime in full (OTIF) %’, 'count of the Total order lines', 'line fill rate', 'volume fill rate', 'total orders', 'on time target', 'in full target', 'on time in full target' of the customer orders daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.
